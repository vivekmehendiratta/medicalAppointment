# Table of contents

# Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggle open dataset 'Brazil medical appointment' from 2016 to better understand:

    Are there any repetitive offenders (repetitive patients who have cancelled the appointment previously) ?
    How wait times correlate with no-shows ?
    Does age have any effect on no-shows ?


# File Descriptions

There is single notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vivekmehendiratta/medical-appointment-no-shows-7ec705c9a048).
